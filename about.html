					<h2> Who Am I? </h2>
					<p> It all began three and a half years ago when my family moved to Cambridge from Charleston, South Carolina. As scared
						and nervous as I was, I was also excited and happy. I started thinking about how different my life would be in Cambridge
						without my relatives, leaving friends behind, and being in a completely different environment. I learned many new things
						about myself and my values being in such a different environment. When we first moved, my family and I thought we would
						stay here for one year but when the year ended, we decided to make Cambridge home. I am currently attending Cambridge
						Rindge and Latin School as a 9th grader. Though I haven't been able to be inside the school building much due to the
						pandemic, I feel connected to the school. During this time of remote learning I have found that I enjoy online learning
						very much, and hope that some form of remote learning will be continued when we return to school in person. I find
						inspiration and joy in the arts, specifically visual and preforming arts. Such as dance, painting, singing and, drawing.
						Such things are also my hobbies, but include baking and making music. Though I am not entirely sure of what I want
						my future to hold, I do hope to have a job that I enjoy,and have time to continue my hobbies. Since I've been thinking
						more about what I want to do in the future, colleges, jobs, and my aspirations in life. Iâ€™ve decided to try new things
						that I have not done before. In the future, I want a fulfilling life and that starts with pursuing my interest and
						things I find enjoyable.</p>
